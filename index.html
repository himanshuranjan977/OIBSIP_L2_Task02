            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p><span></span>Adolf Hitler was an Austrian-born German politician who was the dictator of Germany from 1933 until his suicide in 1945. He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party, becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then taking the title
                of Führer und Reichskanzler in 1934. During his dictatorship, he initiated World War II in Europe by invading Poland on 1 September 1939. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration
                of the Holocaust: the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims.</p>

            <div class="bio">
                <div>
                    <h4>Early Life</h4>
                    <p>Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary (in present-day Austria), close to the border with the German Empire.He was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and his third wife, Klara
                        Pölzl. Three of Hitler's siblings—Gustav, Ida, and Otto—died in infancy.Also living in the household were Alois's children from his second marriage: Alois Jr. (born 1882) and Angela (born 1883).When Hitler was three, the family
                        moved to Passau, Germany.[19] There he acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect, rather than Austrian German, which marked his speech throughout his life.The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding in 1894, and
                        in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-funded primary school) in nearby Fischlham</p>

                    <h4>Entry into politics</h4>
                    <p>After World War I, Hitler returned to Munich.Without formal education or career prospects, he remained in the army.In July 1919 he was appointed Verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an Aufklärungskommando (reconnaissance unit) of
                        the Reichswehr, assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers' Party (DAP). At a DAP meeting on 12 September 1919, Party Chairman Anton Drexler was impressed with Hitler's oratorical skills. He gave
                        him a copy of his pamphlet My Political Awakening, which contained anti-Semitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Marxist ideas.On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party, and within a week was
                        accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party).</p>

                <div>
                    <h4>Rise to power</h4>
                    <p>The Great Depression provided a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic, which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists. The moderate political parties were increasingly
                        unable to stem the tide of extremism, and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology.The elections of September 1930 resulted in the break-up of a grand coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet.
                        Its leader, chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Centre Party, governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg. Governance by decree became the new norm and paved the way for authoritarian forms of government.
                        The Nazi Party rose from obscurity to win 18.3 per cent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election, becoming the second-largest party in parliament..</p>
                    <p>At the risk of appearing to talk nonsense I tell you that the National Socialist movement will go on for 1,000 years! ... Don't forget how people laughed at me 15 years ago when I declared that one day I would govern Germany. They
                        laugh now, just as foolishly, when I declare that I shall remain in power
                        <p></p> — Adolf Hitler to a British correspondent in Berlin, June 1934</p>

                    <h4>Nazi Germany</h4>
                    <p>In August 1934, Hitler appointed Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht as Minister of Economics, and in the following year, as Plenipotentiary for War Economy in charge of preparing the economy for war.Reconstruction and rearmament
                        were financed through Mefo bills, printing money, and seizing the assets of people arrested as enemies of the State, including Jews.Unemployment fell from six million in 1932 to one million in 1936.Hitler oversaw one of the largest
                        infrastructure improvement campaigns in German history, leading to the construction of dams, autobahns, railroads, and other civil works. Wages were slightly lower in the mid to late 1930s compared with wages during the Weimar
                        Republic, while the cost of living increased by 25 per cent.The average work week increased during the shift to a war economy; by 1939, the average German was working between 47 and 50 hours a week.</p>

                    <h4>World War II</h4>
                    <p>In February 1938, on the advice of his newly appointed foreign minister, the strongly pro-Japanese Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler ended the Sino-German alliance with the Republic of China to instead enter into an alliance with the
                        more modern and powerful Empire of Japan. Hitler announced German recognition of Manchukuo, the Japanese-occupied state in Manchuria, and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan .Hitler ordered
                        an end to arms shipments to China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army.In retaliation, Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek cancelled all Sino-German economic agreements, depriving the Germans of many Chinese
                        raw materials.</p>

                <div>
                    <h4>Death of Adolf Hitler</h4>
                    <p>Adolf Hitler, chancellor and dictator of Germany from 1933 to 1945, died by suicide via gunshot on 30 April 1945 in the Führerbunker in Berlin[a] after it became clear that Germany would lose the Battle of Berlin, which led to the
                        end of World War II in Europe. Eva Braun, his wife of one day, also died by suicide, taking cyanide.In accordance with Hitler's prior written and verbal instructions, that afternoon their remains were carried up the stairs and
                        through the bunker's emergency exit to the Reich Chancellery garden, where they were doused in petrol and burned.The news of Hitler's death was announced on German radio the next day, 1 May.</p>
